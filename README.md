# Dislocated

This project is postponed due to the lack of the ability to manually trigger
disconnect event when interracting with Discord API. 

Development may continue in future once I figured out a way.

# features
- non blocking
- pekko based
- rate limit handling (somehow pretty rare from what I've seen)
